    A simple decorator that requires a user to be logged in. If they are not
    logged in the request is examined for a 'authorization' header.

    If the header is present it is tested for basic authentication and
    the user is logged in with the provided credentials.

    If the header is not present a http 401 is sent back to the
    requestor to provide credentials.

    The purpose of this is that in several django projects I have needed
    several specific views that need to support basic authentication, yet the
    web site as a whole used django's provided authentication.

    The uses for this are for urls that are access programmatically such as
    by rss feed readers, yet the view requires a user to be logged in. Many rss
    readers support supplying the authentication credentials via http basic
    auth (and they do NOT support a redirect to a form where they post a
    username/password.)

    Use is simple:

    @logged_in_or_basicauth
    def your_view:
        ...

    You can provide the name of the realm to ask for authentication within.
